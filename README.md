# Smart Embedded Alarm System

## Course
SWE-450 – Embedded Systems

## Description
This project implements a Smart Embedded Alarm System using
an ARM HPS running a C application and custom FPGA logic.
The system uses GPIO and memory-mapped I/O to interface with
input peripherals and output devices.

## Features
- State-based alarm control
- GPIO input handling
- FPGA interaction (Release 1)
- LED / display / audio outputs

## Repository Structure
- src/main.c – Main embedded application

## Status
Embedded Application Release 1 (Milestone 2)
